This is my second continuous assessment assignemnt for my AI module in college.

The aim of this project is to create a machine learning model for a dataset. Through this project I used tutorials online as well to aid creating the models which will give the most accurate results. The main models I created are for predicting the price of pizzas based on different parameters. I also chose two of the companies to classify whether you'd buy a pizza from one place or the other depending on features.
